                <p>Our online application form is straightforward, and should take about 15 minutes to complete. Before you begin, it's worth having your national insurance number handy, as well as a photo or scan of your payslip and bank statements. You may be asked to provide these as part of the process.</p>
                <p>Once your application has been received, it will be looked at by a member of our loans team, who will use the information you've provided to decide whether or not we can approve your application. This can take 7-10 days. We'll update you by SMS and let you know the outcome when this step is complete.</p>
                <p>If your application is approved, you'll be asked to sign a loan agreement setting out the terms of your loan, including details such as the amount to be borrowed and the repayment period.</p>
                <p>Once the loan agreement is signed, we'll transfer the funds into your account within 2-3 working days. Loan repayments will then take place on the date and via the method agreed.</p>

                <p>We will make a decision based on how much you have applied for, and our assessment of your ability to repay. We'll do this by at your income, expenditure and credit history. When you apply, we may ask you to provide bank statements and payslips as evidence of this.</p>
                <p> All loan decisions are made by a person, not a computer, and so we will always try to take the whole picture into account. In cases where we canâ€™t approve the full amount, we may be able to offer you a lesser amount, or an alternative rate.</p>
